To access the Dml Parsing Library:
  1. Add the Dml Parsing Library for C++ folder to your include file path.
  2. In one compilation unit (such as StdAfx.cpp or Main.cpp), add the following two lines:

	#define PrimaryModule
	#include "Dml.h"

  3. In all other compilation units, add the following one line:

	#include "Dml.h"

That's it, at least to get you connected!
